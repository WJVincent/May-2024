## Assessment

## HTML / CSS

This section of content relies more heavily on reading the docs and experimentation
than anything else we have covered so far. It is impossible for us to go over
everything in class and it would be a waste of your time if we did so.

I will consistently be pushing you to answer your own questions with css. The
most important thing to realize is that are a million and a half ways to solve
every problem. Explore, fail, refactor and push your understanding forward.
