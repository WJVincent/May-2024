## Question Asking Level Up

When you ask a question we are going to expect you to level up now that we are in the second mod. "I don't understand" will no longer be sufficient, we will close the question to give you some more time to think, and wait for you to ask the question again with more thought. We will be keeping the "magic question button" only for assessments, all other questions should be asked in the new questions channel in discord.

- Describe the problem
    - Is something not happening that you believe should be happening?
        - You are getting different output than you anticipated, etc.
    - Are you getting an error?
- Describe the debugging you have done so far
    - Have you tested the values you are interacting with?
        - console log or debugger

This is an important step in becoming a more self sufficient and hireable developer, get into the weeds and build up those debugging skills!
